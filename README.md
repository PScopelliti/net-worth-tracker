## Description

Net Worth Tracker is a full-featured personal finance application built for Italian investors. It provides comprehensive portfolio tracking, performance analytics, cashflow management, dividend monitoring, and long-term financial planning tools — all in a single dashboard.

The app integrates with Yahoo Finance for real-time price updates and includes advanced features like Monte Carlo simulations, FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) projections, and AI-powered performance analysis via Claude. The UI is in Italian while the codebase follows English conventions.

## Key Features

### Portfolio Management
- Multi-asset tracking across stocks, ETFs, bonds, crypto, real estate, commodities, and cash
- Automatic price updates via Yahoo Finance (all assets) and Borsa Italiana (Italian bonds with ISIN)
- Bond coupon scheduling: automatic coupon generation with step-up rate tiers and final premium (Premio Finale) support — full BTP Valore compatible
- Average cost tracking with 4-decimal precision
- Current vs target asset allocation visualization

### Performance Analytics
- Comprehensive metrics: ROI, CAGR, TWR, IRR, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown
- Yield on Cost (YOC) and Current Yield calculations
- Monthly returns heatmap and underwater drawdown chart
- Rolling performance charts
- AI-powered analysis using Claude with Extended Thinking and web search

### Cashflow
- Income and expense tracking with custom categories and subcategories
- Bulk move transactions between categories/subcategories (cross-type supported)
- 5-layer Sankey diagram visualization
- 4-level drill-down for detailed expense analysis
- Period analysis with year and month filters
- CSV export

### Dividends
- Multi-currency dividend recording with automatic EUR conversion
- Borsa Italiana scraping for Italian market data (dividends and bond prices)
- Monthly calendar view with drill-down
- Dividend statistics and yield calculations
- **Total Return per Asset**: table combining unrealized capital gain % and all-time net dividends received % (calculated at historical cost basis per payment, not diluted by later purchases) to show the true investment return per asset
- **Dividend Per Share Growth**: year-by-year gross DPS history per equity asset with YoY% and CAGR columns; portfolio median growth rate shown as a summary

### Historical Analysis
- Automatic monthly portfolio snapshots (via Vercel cron)
- Net worth evolution, asset class breakdown, and liquidity charts
- Year-over-Year variation analysis
- Savings vs Investment Growth comparison (annual and monthly views)
- Doubling time analysis with geometric calculations and fixed thresholds

### FIRE Planning
- FIRE calculator with primary residence exclusion
- Multi-scenario projections (Bear / Base / Bull) with inflation adjustment
- Per-scenario FIRE numbers with automatic savings stop at FIRE reached
- **Goal-Based Investing**: allocate portfolio portions to financial goals (house, retirement, emergency fund, etc.) with progress tracking, recommended allocation comparison, and open-ended goal support
- **Goal-Driven Allocation**: optionally derive portfolio allocation targets as a weighted average of goal recommended allocations, with automatic fallback to manual targets

### Monte Carlo Simulations
- 4 asset classes: Equity, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities
- Editable parameters per asset class (returns, volatility)
- Bear/Base/Bull scenario comparison with overlay charts and distribution analysis
- Auto-fill allocation from real portfolio (crypto and cash excluded, normalized to 100%)

### Other
- **Hall of Fame** — Monthly and annual performance rankings with multi-section note system
- **PDF Export** — 8 configurable sections with custom year/month period selection; sections auto-disabled for past periods when historical data is unavailable

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GiuseppeDM98/net-worth-tracker.git

npm install

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Firebase credentials (see Prerequisites below)

```

> For the full setup guide including Firebase configuration and Firestore security rules, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.x or higher
- **Firebase project** with Firestore + Authentication enabled (free tier is sufficient)
- **Vercel account** (recommended for deployment and cron jobs)

**Key design patterns:**
- **App Router** with protected dashboard routes
- **Service layer** (`lib/services/`) for all business logic
- **React Query** for client-side data caching and mutations
- **Feature-based component organization** (by domain, not by layer)
- **Timezone-aware** date handling (Europe/Rome)

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Framework | Next.js 16, React 19 | SSR, routing, API routes |
| Language | TypeScript 5 | Type safety |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui | UI components and design system |
| Data | React Query (TanStack) | Client-side caching and server state |
| Backend | Firebase (Firestore + Auth) | Database and authentication |
| Charts | Recharts, @nivo/sankey | Data visualization |
| Finance | yahoo-finance2 | Real-time price data |
| AI | @anthropic-ai/sdk | Performance analysis |
| PDF | @react-pdf/renderer | Export reports |
| Forms | react-hook-form, zod | Form handling and validation |
| Dates | date-fns, date-fns-tz | Timezone-aware date operations |
| Scraping | cheerio | Borsa Italiana dividend and bond price data |
| Testing | Vitest | Unit testing (201 tests) |

## Development

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server with hot-reload
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm test           # Run unit tests (single run)
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Conventions

- **UI language**: Italian
- **Code language**: English (comments explain WHY, not WHAT — see [COMMENTS.md](COMMENTS.md))
- **Responsive breakpoint**: `desktop:` (1025px) instead of Tailwind's default `lg:`
- **Radix Select**: No empty string values — use sentinel values like `__all__`
- **Settings changes**: Always update type definition + getter + setter together

## Deployment

The recommended deployment target is **Vercel**:

1. Import the repository on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Add all environment variables from `.env.local`
3. Deploy — cron jobs for snapshots and dividends are configured in `vercel.json`

Two cron jobs run daily at 18:00 UTC:
- `/api/cron/monthly-snapshot` — Automatic monthly portfolio snapshots
- `/api/cron/daily-dividend-processing` — Dividend data processing

> For detailed deployment instructions, see [VERCEL_SETUP.md](VERCEL_SETUP.md).
